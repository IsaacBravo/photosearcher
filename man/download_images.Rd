\description{
Downloads images based on their Flickr ID. Uses the flickr.photos.getSizes
API method from the Flickr API to test whether you have permission to
download an image. See
\url{https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getSizes.html} for
more information on the API method. If permission is available the image is
downloaded and saved as a .jpeg in a given save directory.
}
\details{
Please be aware that download times will vary depending on number of
photographs, size of photographs, internet speed and other factors.
Downloading a large amount of photographs may take some time.

When running the function you need an API key saved as
photosearcher_key.sysdata in your working directory. If this is the first
function you run you will be prompted to create and enter your API key. The
API key will then be saved as photosearcher_key.sysdata in your working
directory and is used for all function.
